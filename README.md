This repo contains details my submission for the example RADAR exercise completed as part of the application for the Civic Lab Manager position with BetaNYC.

It consists of two parts:
1. A client-facing report: `311-report.pdf`
2. An R Markdown document detailing analysis: `transmitter-311-analysis.md`

Thank you for your consideration,<br>
Andrew
